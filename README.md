## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Yanina, a Junior Full-Stack Developer
<!--
**Yanina1992/Yanina1992** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I recently completed a full-time web development bootcamp, gaining proficiency in HTML5, CSS, JS, TS, Angular, SCSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end, and C#, .NET, ASP.NET, Web Form, MVC, Entity Framework, jQuery, SQL Server in the latter part of the course.
My foundation is now robust enough for independent web application development, and I am equally adept at collaborative teamwork, leveraging tools like GitHub.

My project goals center around delivering an intuitive user experience and ensuring a high level of functionality (you can review my works here). And, I must confess, I am a perfectionist.

I have a genuine passion for learning, and this journey is only the beginning!

I am currently exploring new opportunities, and I invite you to reach out if you are looking for a reliable team member.
